The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can lead to unexpected results if not used carefully.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a flexbox item might not work as expected if the parent doesn't have a defined width.  Another issue is combining units inconsistently, like trying `calc(100px + 10%)` which might be interpreted differently across browsers.
