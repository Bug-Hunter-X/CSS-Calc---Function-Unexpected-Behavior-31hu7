# CSS Calc() Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, issue encountered when using the CSS `calc()` function, particularly in the context of flexbox layouts and unit mixing.  The `bug.css` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected and more robust approach.

**Issue:** The `calc()` function's behavior can be unpredictable if not used with precision, potentially leading to layout inconsistencies across browsers.

**Solution:** Implement a more reliable layout that defines parent container dimensions or avoids unit mixing within `calc()` expressions. Careful consideration of the context in which `calc()` is used is crucial for consistent results.
